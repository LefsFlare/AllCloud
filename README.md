# AllCloud
This is a branch-off of the original [SadCloud](https://github.com/Locercus/SadCloud) plugin, do not install any builds I have on my Jenkins server unless you are willing to stick with an inexperienced developer modifying other people's codes.

Since this little branch-off is meant for me to learn fast and learn more on the wonders of Bukkit coding, please feel welcome to provide feedback OR provide ideas for me to attempt to work on. Unless the feedback is for nothing but the joy of trolling, it will **definitely** be deleted/ignored.
